## Findings

No effect:

* From first look 2020 might have looked like a special year, but no weather anomalies were found. <br>

Bad example: <br>

* Covid was spread by human interactions - Super spreader event of Shincheonji Church made bad situation worse. Province border shut down would have prevented it.<br>


Good example: 

* Overseas inflow cases has been stopped after mandatory 14 day quarantine (Covid symptoms mostly show by 2 weeks).
* Most venerable patients are elderly, but high numbers of Korean elderly live alone and this came in favor when pandemic hit.
* Search trends gives a glimpse into real time event of population.
* Large amount of testing helps evaluate the severity of pandemic. 

## Suggestions for Health Care Officials

* Implement 14 day quarantine for all incoming travelers.
